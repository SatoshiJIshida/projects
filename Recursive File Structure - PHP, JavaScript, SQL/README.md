# Recursive File Structure

## Objectives
A recursive file structure for storing system directories with a user interface that allows the user to type a search term and search for any file or folder within the file system.\
\
This uses string representations of directories and files within directories, in order to represent a computer's file system.\
The file system structure handles any type of recursive file system structure. We can add in a new folder, subfolder, or file and the system will handle it and create the directories based on a text file 'data.csv'. This text file contains the file system structure, which is read and inserted into a MySQL database.\
A user interface allows the user to type a search term to search for any file or folder within the database and the database retrieves and displays all directories containing the search term.
