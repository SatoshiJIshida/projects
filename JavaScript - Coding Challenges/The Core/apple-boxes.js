/**
 * You have k apple boxes full of apples. Each square box of size m contains m Ã— m apples.
 * You just noticed two interesting properties about the boxes:
 * 
 * The smallest box is size 1, the next one is size 2,..., all the way up to size k.
 * Boxes that have an odd size contain only yellow apples. Boxes that have an even size contain only red apples.
 * Your task is to calculate the difference between the number of red apples and the number of yellow apples.
 * 
 * Example:
 * For k = 5, the output should be solution(k) = -15.
 * There are 1 + 3 * 3 + 5 * 5 = 35 yellow apples and 2 * 2 + 4 * 4 = 20 red apples, making the answer 20 - 35 = -15.
 * 
 * [execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)
 * [input] integer k
 * 
 * [output] integer
 * The difference between the two types of apples.
 * 
 * Tests passed: 18/18.
