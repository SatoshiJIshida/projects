          <p>This game is going to teach you about Modularity concepts.</p>

          <p>
            Modularity in software engineering is the separation of a systemâ€™s
            different functions into separate independent modules, which are
            then combined together into a unified system. This allows complex
            systems to be broken down into independent modules that can be
            updated separately and efficiently. Moreover, this allows new
            modules to easily be added to a system for expansion in adding new
            functionality.
          </p>

          <p>
            The example used here is Microservices, which is one of the ways
            that Modularity is applied to software. The Microservice
            architecture is an architectural style that structures an
            application as a collection of services. Each service is a loosely
            coupled module, meaning that each module has little or no knowledge
            of the definitions of other separate modules. Therefore, each module
            is independent for efficient updating, testing and expansion and is
            independently deployable. Furthermore, new services can be added to
            a system with ease, to extend its functionality by adding new
            modules.
