# Calendar Reminders
Satoshi Ishida
<br><br>
The current database implementation has its read/write rules set to false, to avoid spam.\
<br><br>

## Objectives
A calendar reminders application in a year and month view, that allows the user to store/read reminders and receive a notification if there is a reminder on the current day.
<br><br><br>

## Type of Software
Web App
<br><br><br>

## Languages
JavaScript: React Framework\
SCSS
<br><br><br>

## API Used
Firebase Realtime Database
<br><br><br>

## Testing
Libraries: Jest, Enzyme and React Testing Library
- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- Non-functional Testing
	- Understandability
	- Usability
	- Modifiability
	- Reliability
	- Accessibility - if implemented in the real world it would need a user login.
<br><br><br>

## Notes & Future Work
Both Year View and Month View are responsive utilising media queries.\
A real-world implementation would need user registration and login, or to implement Calendar Reminders as part of a larger system such as an OS.
